# matlab-sim-env

`matlab-sim-env` is a framework for performing numerical simulation of dynamic systems based on MATLAB. `matlab-sim-env` provides several essential components including variable classes, function classes, system classes, data-structure classes and simulator classes.

Currently, `matlab-sim-env` is on develop. The main focus of the work is concentrated on flight systems such as fixed-wing aircraft, multicopter, missile, etc. However, the framework is designed to be readily extended to other dynamic systems.

Main contributors for each directory are as the following:
* `core` 
  * Sangmin Lee (Flight Dynamics and Control Lab., Seoul National University)
* `multicopter`
